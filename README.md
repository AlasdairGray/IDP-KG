# IDPcentral Scripts, Data, and Notebooks

This repository contains the scripts to generate the IDPcentral Knowledge Graph based on data harvested from [DisProt](https://disprot.org/), [MobiDB](https://mobidb.org/), and [ProteinEnsemble (PED)](https://proteinensemble.org/).

The starting point for this repository were the files developed during the ELIXIR sponsored BioHackathon-Europe 2020. That work was reported in [BioHackrXiv v3jct](https://doi.org/10.37044/osf.io/v3jct). This repo updates the scripts for the revised deployments, and scales the work to the entire content of the three sites.

### Notes

- The term 'source' is used to distinguish the page that was scraped
- The term 'dataset' is used to identify the collection of data that a particular record page (e.g. disprot:DP000003) belongs to
