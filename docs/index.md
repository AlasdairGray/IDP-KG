# IDP-KG

The Intrinsically Disordered Protein Knowledge Graph (IDP-KG) supports the discovery of information about proteins that are known to be disordered. It has been generated from the [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org) markup deployed on three data sources from the [ELIXIR Intrinsically Disordered Protein Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/intrinsically-disordered-proteins). The data sources that are aggregated are:
- [DisProt](https://disprot.org)
- [MobiDB](https://mobidb.org)
- [Protein Ensemble (PED)](https://proteinensemble.org)

## IDP-KG Versions

The following versions of the IDP-KG are available:
- [IDP-KG_2021-09-28](versions/idp-kg_2021-09-28)
- [IDP-KG_2021-09-07](versions/idp-kg_2021-09-28)

This work was funded as part of the [ELIXIR Interoperability Platform](https://www.elixir-europe.org/services/interoperability/) Strategic Implementation Study [_"Bioschemas Markup to Support ELIXIR Communities"_](https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/commissioned-services/exploiting-bioschemas-markup-support-elixir-communities).

Early stages of this work were carried out during the [BioHackathon Europe 2020](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/) organized by [ELIXIR](https://elixir-europe.org/) in November 2020. We thank the organizers and fellow participants for their discussions and contributions.
